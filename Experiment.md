## Training

### Data Construction

**Training Configuration:**
```yaml
cutoff_len: 4096
per_device_train_batch_size: 4
gradient_accumulation_steps: 4
learning_rate: 1e-5
num_train_epochs: 3.0
lr_scheduler_type: cosine
warmup_ratio: 0.1
```

We use DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 for distributed training. Chat templates are set according to model families:
- `qwen` for Qwen2.5-7B
- `llama3` for Llama-3.1-8B

### Data Quality

**Training Configuration:**
```yaml
cutoff_len: 32768
packing: false
per_device_train_batch_size: 1
gradient_accumulation_steps: 4
learning_rate: 5.0e-6
num_train_epochs: 3.0
lr_scheduler_type: cosine
warmup_ratio: 0.1
bf16: true
```

We use DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 for distributed training. Chat templates are set according to model families:
- `qwen` for Qwen2.5-7B
- `llama3` for Llama-3.1-8B
- `mistral` for Mistral-7B-v0.3

## Evaluation config

### General Text

General text evaluation uses [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) with MMLU-Redux as the primary benchmark:

- max_model_len: 32768
- num_fewshot: 5
- apply_chat_template: true

### Math

Math evaluation is performed using [Qwen2.5-Math](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math) with the following generation parameters:

- temperature: 0.6
- max_tokens_per_call: 16384
- top_p: 1
- apply_chat_template: true

**Benchmarks:** GSM8K, AMC23, AIME24, Minerva Math, Gaokao2024-Mix, OlympiadBench, and MATH.

### Science

Science evaluation follows the MegaScience evaluation protocol. Benchmarks include MMLU-STEM, MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, ChemBench, PIQA, and SciBench.

### Medical

Medical evaluation employs MedR-Bench, MedMCQA, and MedCaseReasoning.

### Finance

Finance evaluation uses XFinBench, FinEval-KR, and CPA-QKA.

### Law

Law evaluation uses LegalBench and LexGLUE.

> For benchmarks consisting of multiple subtasks, we report the average score across all subtasks. For tasks evaluated by exact answer matching in Medical, Finance and Law, we additionally employ an LLM-as-a-judge protocol.

Models are served using vLLM for inference in Medical, Finance and Law.

## Data Selection

The Data Selection track selects subsets from the same candidate pools used in the Data Quality track and then trains a [Qwen2.5-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B) model on each selected subset. The training configuration is identical to the Data Quality track, with one exception: the selected subset is used in full and is **not** truncated to 20k samples. Because the Law pool contains fewer than 100k samples, Law selection results are reported only for k = 1k and 10k.

### Training Datasets

| Domain | Dataset | Pool Size | Selection Budgets (k) |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Math | [ScaleQuest-Math](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dyyyyyyyy/ScaleQuest-Math) | — | 1k / 10k / 100k |
| General | [WizardLM_evol_instruct_V2_196k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WizardLMTeam/WizardLM_evol_instruct_V2_196k) (143k subset) | 143,000 | 1k / 10k / 100k |
| Science | [MegaScience](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MegaScience/MegaScience) | — | 1k / 10k / 100k |
| Medical | [UltraMedical](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TsinghuaC3I/UltraMedical) | — | 1k / 10k / 100k |
| Finance | [Finance-Instruct-500k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Josephgflowers/Finance-Instruct-500k) | 500,000 | 1k / 10k / 100k |
| Law | [Lawyer-Llama](https://github.com/AndrewZhe/lawyer-llama) | — | 1k / 10k |

For embedding-similarity selectors, the domain proxy for each domain is built by sampling 200 examples from the target dataset used for MMD computation in the Data Quality track.
